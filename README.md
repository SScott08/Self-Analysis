# Self-Analysis

I had a geat group to work with. We only had one member that did not do much contributing. I was responsible for all the visualization portion of the presentation. I created a slide show which we ended up incorporating it all onto the dashboards just to eliminate switching back and forth between screens during the presentation. wrote the entire
README file. I tried to add portions of each persons part to keep it consistent on the process, approach and outcome we took. 

I feel like I really struggle when it comes to the Machine Learning portion, I would have done more database stuuf but Ajinder and Franklin were proficient in it and preferred to do it. Overall I tried to be available and help in any way possible. Overall, I feel like time wa an issue throughout this course for me. I also feel like we only touch the surface of so many programs it becomes difficult to get a firm grasp on things. But I had an amazing tutpr, Bill Parker that we a definate lifeline for me. I do feel like I would benefit from more indepth classes on several of the modules.
